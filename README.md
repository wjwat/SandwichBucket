## :memo: Description

Got a bucket? Got some sandwiches? Put the sandwiches in a bucket. Buckets are great for a lot of things. I think at some point in everyone's life they should have a moment where they say to themselves "This situation would be improved if I had a bucket with me right now". Then on top of that what if in that moment you were hungry as well? And the bucket had sandwiches? Phew, now you're talking about a completely different level to this thing. Chilling out, eating sandwiches, you've got a bucket; what else is there?

Second scenario: You're a prominent physician, the talk of the town, and someone murders the love of your life: your wife. The police blame you, but you're innocent. What do you do? You escape, you go on the run, you take your sandwich bucket and do your best to prove your innocence. "PUT THE SANDWICH DOWN!" they yell, but you can't. That sandwich will prove your innocence. So you jump. You jump for freedom, for America, for your wife. You've just made an enemy for life in Tommy Lee Jones. And he hates buckets.
